# Real-Time Speech-to-Text Display with OBS üé§üì∫

This guide will help you set up a real-time speech-to-text display using a Python script, OBS (Open Broadcaster Software), and a virtual audio driver. This setup is perfect for streamers, educators, or anyone looking to add live transcriptions to their video content. üöÄ

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x üêç
- OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) üìπ
- A virtual audio driver (e.g., VB-CABLE, Virtual Audio Cable) üîä

## Step 1: Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install vosk pyaudio
```

## Step 2: Download Speech Recognition Model

1. Download a Vosk model from [here](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-space/blob/master/models.md). Choose the model that suits your language needs.
2. Unzip the downloaded model to a directory on your machine. Ensure the folder structure looks like `model_name/am`, `model_name/conf`, `model_name/graph`, etc.

## Step 3: Set Up Virtual Audio Driver

1. Install a virtual audio driver on your system.
2. Go to your system's sound settings and set the virtual audio device as the default playback device. This will route all audio through the virtual cable.
3. Enable "Listen to this device" in the properties of the virtual audio device and select your main audio device as the playback device. This allows you to hear the audio while it's being processed.

## Step 4: Configure OBS

1. Open OBS and create a new scene.
2. Add an "Audio Output Capture" source and select the virtual audio driver as the device. This captures all audio routed through the virtual cable.
3. Add a "Text (GDI+)" source. Under the "Text File (read from file)" option, browse and select the `partial_results.txt` file that will be generated by the Python script.

## Step 5: Run the Python Script

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script by executing `python script_name.py`.
4. When prompted, enter the device index of the virtual audio driver as listed in the terminal.

## Step 6: Start Speaking

Begin speaking into your microphone. The script will transcribe your speech in real-time, and OBS will display the text on your video stream.

## Notes

- You may need to adjust the microphone and virtual audio driver settings in your system and OBS for optimal audio capture and transcription quality.
- The script provided continuously updates a text file with live transcription, which OBS reads and displays. Ensure OBS is set to refresh the text source to see the updates in real-time.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with audio capture or transcription, check the following:
- The virtual audio driver is correctly installed and configured.
- The correct device index is used in the script for the virtual audio driver.
- Python dependencies are properly installed.
